# Analysis of Social Distancing Traffic Changes in Portland

For this project I used a subset of the data from the PORTAL Transportation Data Archive to create two interactive dashboards. These dashboard visualizations compare the months/years of traffic in Portland, Oregon before Covid-19 to the months and year of traffic during Covid-19. The goal of this is to analyze how a pandemic like Covid-19 can change traffic patterns in a major city like Portland, Oregon.

The dashboards can be seen at the following link: *placeholder*.

## Project Components

There are two main components to this project:
 - Data Pipeline <br>
 - Data Visualization <br>
 
I created a website *placeholder* that embeds two interactive dashboards and is hosted in Google Cloud. The dashboards were created using Tableau. The dashboards are fed data from a Cloud SQL database that I created to maintain the cleansed data. The cleansed data comes from the Portal Transportation Data Archive and is preprocessed in Apache Spark before being stored in the SQL database.
