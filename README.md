# Analysis of Traffic Changes in Portland, OR Due to Social Distancing

For this project, I used a subset of the data from PORTAL Transportation Data Archive to create two interactive dashboards. The dashboards can be seen at the following link: *placeholder*.

## Project Components

There are two main components to this project:
 - Data Pipeline <br>
 - Data Visualization <br>
 
I created a website *placeholder* that embeds two interactive dashboards and is hosted in Google Cloud. The dashboards were created using Tableau. The dashboards are fed data from a Cloud SQL database that I created to maintain the cleansed data. The cleansed data comes from the Portal Transportation Data Archive and is preprocessed in Apache Spark before being stored in the SQL database.
