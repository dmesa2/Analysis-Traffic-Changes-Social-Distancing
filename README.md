# Analysis of Social Distancing Traffic Changes in Portland

For this project, I used a subset of the data from the PORTAL Transportation Data Archive to create two interactive dashboards. These dashboards compare the traffic pattern changes due to social distancing in Portland, OR. The goal of this is to analyze how social distancing during a pandemic can change traffic patterns in a major city like Portland, Oregon.

The dashboards can be seen at the following link: https://tinyurl.com/yyetssvd

## Project Components

There are two main components to this project:
 - Data Pipeline <br>
 - Data Visualization <br>
 
I created a website: https://tinyurl.com/yyetssvd that embeds two interactive dashboards and is hosted in Google Cloud. The dashboards were created using Tableau. The data comes from the Portal Transportation Data Archive and is processed in Apache Spark before being imported to Tableau.
